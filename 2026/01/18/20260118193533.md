## Message: Fix cadence syncing to only sync for appropriate activity types

Use ActivityKind.getCycleUnit() to determine if cadence should be synced.
Only sync StepsCadenceRecord for step-based activities (walking, running, hiking) and CyclingPedalingCadenceRecord for cycling activities.
Skip cadence syncing for activities with other cycle units (strokes, jumps, reps, swings) as Health Connect lacks appropriate cadence record types.

Note: Swimming workouts with stroke data (freestyle, backstroke, etc.) could be synced as ExerciseSegment records in a future enhancement.
