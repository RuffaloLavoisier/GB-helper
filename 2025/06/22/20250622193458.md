# Commit: c9a9ae8ad003a949bbdf46a8c98b151bf9b97fc8
## Message: ble: introduce getServiceDiscoveryDelay and apply BtLEQueue settings (2/2)

1/2:
- rename AbstractBTLEDeviceSupport to AbstractBTLESingleDeviceSupport
- apply all BtLEQueue settings before processing starts
- introduce getServiceDiscoveryDelay to support device specific delay between STATE_CONNECTED and getServices/discoverServices
2/2:
- add a new AbstractBTLEDeviceSupport as a common super class of AbstractBTLEMultiDeviceSupport and AbstractBTLESingleDeviceSupport
